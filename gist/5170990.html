Bitcoin Mining On Raspberry Pi
==============================

This is a quick and dirty guide to Bitcoin Mining on your Raspberry Pi.
It&#39;s not going to be fast or efficient and may cause damage. I&#39;m not responsible if you break anything, kill a cat or your wife leaves you as a result of this.

The following commands are to be run via either Terminal on the Pi or via SSH.
If you are looking for a Windows SSH client, I recommend [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`sudo aptitude install gcc gcc-4.5 g++ g++-4.5 libstdc++6-4.5-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl3-dev make less `

`sudo aptitude install ia32-libs ia32-libs-gtk lib32gcc1 lib32stdc++6 lib32z1 libc6-i386`

`sudo mkdir bitcoind`

`cd bitcoind`

`wget http://yyz.us/bitcoin/cpuminer-1.0.2.tar.gz`

`sudo tar -zxvf cpuminer-1.0.2.tar.gz`

`cd cpuminer-1.0.2`

`sudo ./configure`

`sudo make`

`./minerd --url  http://pit.deepbit.net:8332 --userpass antony.bailey@thepoliceoftheinter.net_raspb:pi`
